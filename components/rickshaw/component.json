  "readme": "# Rickshaw\n\nRickshaw is a JavaScript toolkit for creating interactive time series graphs, developed at [Shutterstock](http://www.shutterstock.com)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nGetting started with a simple graph is straightforward.  Here's the gist:\n\n```javascript\nvar graph = new Rickshaw.Graph( {\n  element: document.querySelector('#graph'),\n  series: [\n    {\n      color: 'steelblue',\n      data: [ { x: 0, y: 23}, { x: 1, y: 15 }, { x: 2, y: 79 } ],\n    }, {\n      color: 'lightblue',\n      data: [ { x: 0, y: 30}, { x: 1, y: 20 }, { x: 2, y: 64 } ],\n    }\n  ]\n} );\n\ngraph.render();\n```\nSee the [overview](http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/), [tutorial](http://shutterstock.github.com/rickshaw/tutorial/introduction.html), and [examples](http://shutterstock.github.com/rickshaw/examples/) for more.\n\n## Rickshaw.Graph \n\nA Rickshaw graph.  Send an `element` reference, `series` data, and optionally other properties to the constructor before calling `render()` to point the graph.  A listing of properties follows.  Send these as arguments to the constructor, and optionally set them later on already-instantiated graphs with a call to `configure()`\n\n##### element\n\nA reference to an HTML element that should hold the graph. \n\n##### series\n\nArray of objects containing series data to plot.  Each object should contain `data` at a minimum, an array of objects each with x and y properties.  Optionally send a `name` and `color` as well.  Some renderers and extensions may also support additional keys.\n\n##### renderer\n\nA string containing the name of the renderer to be used.  Options include `area`, `stack`, `bar`, `line`, and `scatterplot`.\n\n##### width\n\nWidth of the graph in pixels.  Falls back to the width of the `element`, or defaults to 400 if the element has no width.\n\n##### height\n\nHeight of the graph in pixels.  Falls back to the height of the `element`, or defaults to 250 if the element has no height.\n\n##### min\n\nLower value on the Y-axis, or `auto` for the lowest value in the series.  Defaults to 0.\n\n##### max\n\nHighest value on the Y-axis.  Defaults to the highest value in the series.\n\n##### padding\n\nAn object containing any of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties specifying padding around the extrema of the data in the graph.  Defaults to 0.01 on top for 1% padding, and 0 on other sides.\n\n##### interpolation\n\nLine smoothing / interpolation method (see [D3 docs](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/SVG-Shapes#wiki-line_interpolate)); notable options:\n\n  * `linear`: straight lines between points\n  * `step-after`: square steps from point to point\n  * `cardinal`: smooth curves via cardinal splines (default)\n  * `basis`: smooth curves via B-splines\n\n### Methods\n\nOnce you have instantiated a graph, call methods below to get pixels on the screen, change configuration, and set callbacks.\n\n##### render()\n\nDraw or redraw the graph.\n\n##### configure()\n\nSet properties on an instantiated graph.  Specify any properties the constructor accepts, including `width` and `height` and `renderer`.  Call `render()` to redraw the graph and reflect newly-configured properties.\n\n##### onUpdate(f)\n\nAdd a callback to run when the graph is rendered\n\n\n## Extensions\n\nOnce you have a basic graph, extensions let you add functionality.  See the [overview](http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/) and [examples](http://shutterstock.github.com/rickshaw/examples/) listing for more.\n \n* __Rickshaw.Graph.Legend__ - add a basic legend\n\n* __Rickshaw.Graph.HoverDetail__ - show details on hover\n\n* __Rickshaw.Graph.JSONP__ - get data via a JSONP request\n\n* __Rickshaw.Graph.Annotate__ - add x-axis annotations\n\n* __Rickshaw.Graph.RangeSlider__ - dynamically zoom on the x-axis with a slider\n\n* __Rickshaw.Graph.Axis.Time__ - add x-axis time labels\n\n* __Rickshaw.Graph.Behavior.Series.Highlight__ - highlight series on legend hover\n\n* __Rickshaw.Graph.Behavior.Series.Order__ - reorder series in the stack with drag-and-drop\n\n* __Rickshaw.Graph.Behavior.Series.Toggle__ - toggle series on and off through the legend\n\n\n## Rickshaw.Color.Palette\n\nRickshaw comes with a few color schemes. Instantiate a palette and specify a scheme name, and then call color() on the palette to get each next color.\n\n```javascript\nvar palette = new Rickshaw.Color.Palette( { scheme: 'spectrum2001' } );\n    \npalette.color() // => first color in the palette\npalette.color() // => next color in the palette...\n```\n\n#### Color Schemes\n\n  * classic9\n  * colorwheel\n  * cool\n  * munin\n  * spectrum14\n  * spectrum2000\n  * spectrum2001\n\n#### Interpolation\n\nFor graphs with more series than palettes have colors, sepcify an `interpolatedStopsCount` to the palette constructor.\n\n## Rickshaw and Cross-Browser Support\n\nThis library works in modern browsers and Internet Explorer 9.\n\nRickshaw relies on the HTMLElement#classList API, which isn't natively supported in Internet Explorer 9.  Rickshaw adds support by including a shim which implements the classList API by extending the HTMLElement prototype.  You can disable this behavior if you like, by setting `RICKSHAW_NO_COMPAT` to a true value before including the library. \n\n\n## Dependencies & Building\n\nRickshaw relies on the fantastic [D3 visualization library](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/) to do lots of the heavy lifting for stacking and rendering to SVG.\n\nSome extensions require [jQuery](http://jquery.com) and [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com), but for drawing some basic graphs you'll be okay without.\n\nFor building, we need [Node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](http://npmjs.org).  Running 'make' should get you going with any luck.\n\n## Authors\n\nThis library was developed by David Chester, Douglas Hunter, and Silas Sewell at [Shutterstock](http://www.shutterstock.com)\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (C) 2011 by Shutterstock Images, LLC\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
