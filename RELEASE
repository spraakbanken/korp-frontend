Release manual

These are some guidelines how to release Korp to "labb" or production.

Begin with:
* Make sure that all changed are commited to SVN
* Run all tests:
  > node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update (if you have not already installed webdrivers)
  > grunt test
* If the tests fail, check test case manually and if it works, fix test

Labb (release from trunk):
* Build a release using
  > grunt release --no-post-build
  For this to work, the repository must be checkouted by svn and not git-svn. The reason
  is that we create a file with the SVN revision number for tracking. (dist/karp.yaml).
  (It is still possible to build the dist-folder using just "grunt")
* Do basic testing locally on the built version
  > grunt serve:dist
* Update the server with the new dist folder:
  > rsync --delete -r dist/ fkkorp@k2.spraakdata.gu.se:/var/www/html_sb/korplabb
